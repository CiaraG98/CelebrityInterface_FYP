Format of Dialog Dataset
JSON/Python Dict

dataset keys ==> train, valid
dataset = {'train': [], 'valid': []}, 17,000 personas in train, 1000 in valid
train & valid ==> list of personalities, each personality in a single indexed list

train & valid have keys ==> persona, utterances
Persona: one list of 5ish sentences
utterances: list of around 7/8 dicts, each has keys ==> 'candidates' and 'history' 

candidates ==> list of sentences, around 20
history ==> list of sentences, around 1 at start, ends with 13, increases each index

valid ==> same format, probably for testing, may not need to create one

dataset = {'train': [[{'personality': [...], 'utterances': [{'candidates': [...], 
	'history': [...]}, {'candidates': [...], 'history': [...]}]}]], 
	'valid': ...}


{'personality': ['i like to remodel homes .', 'i like to go hunting .', 
'i like to shoot a bow .', 'my favorite holiday is halloween .'], 'utterances': 
[{'candidates': ['my mom was single with 3 boys , so we never left the projects .', 
'i try to wear all black every day . it makes me feel comfortable .', 
'well nursing stresses you out so i wish luck with sister', 
'yeah just want to pick up nba nfl getting old', 
'i really like celine dion . what about you ?', 'no . i live near farms .', 
"i wish i had a daughter , i'm a boy mom . they're beautiful boys though still lucky", 
'yeah when i get bored i play gone with the wind my favorite movie .', "hi how are you ? i'm eating dinner with my hubby and 2 kids .", 'were you married to your high school sweetheart ? i was .', 'that is great to hear ! are you a competitive rider ?', "hi , i'm doing ok . i'm a banker . how about you ?", "i'm 5 years old", 'hi there . how are you today ?', 'i totally understand how stressful that can be .', 'yeah sometimes you do not know what you are actually watching', 'mother taught me to cook ! we are looking for an exterminator .', 'i enjoy romantic movie . what is your favorite season ? mine is summer .', 'editing photos takes a lot of work .', 'you must be very fast . hunting is one of my favorite hobbies .'], 'history': ["hi , how are you doing ? i'm getting ready to do some cheetah chasing to stay in shape ."]},

*sentences appended to history do not come from candidates
*2/3 sentences added each time

Where is this used in the other python files:
> Utils.py 
file url PERSONACHAT_URL
get_dataset:
downloads data or loads it in cache if already downloaded
reads it with json.loads()
tokenizes and encodes it 

> Train.py
imports get_dataset from utils
get_data_loaders:
uses get_dataset
prepares dialogs for training & evaluation
returns train & valid loader & sampler
used in train function

> Intertact.py
imports get_dataset
uses it to select personality

Notes...
This bot has already been trained on dialog when the code is sourced.
Running interact.py the first time downloads the pretrained model.
After that it just loads the model from its cache.
Would need to build dialog dataset and train it on my machine.
possibly then store trained model e.g. on S3 so that when the interface is loaded,
it doesn't have to train it each time the website is loaded. 

What to do with...
> tweets with https links
> tweets with a lot of @

7 dicts * 20 candidate sentences each => 140 candidate sentences per persona
